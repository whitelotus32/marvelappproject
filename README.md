# Marvel Game App

## Concept
We have created a game app to test your knowledge of the character Spider-Man. Using the SuperHero API, all correct answers are being routed through the API to collect a score for the user. A special gif of Spider-Man will appear on the score page if a user passes the quiz, this is being pulled from the Giphy API.
